## Set up your environment

If you would like to install this project on your computer, you will first need to [clone the repo](https://github.com/EstelleMyddleware/p5-blog-php) of this project using Git.

At the root of your projet, you need to create a .env file (same level as .env.example) in which you need to configure the appropriate values for your blog to run :

```text
# DOCKER Database standard parameters 
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_NAME=blog
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWD=root
#  Replace with your personal SMTP config if you have one
SMTP_PASSWD=ThepasswordlinkedtoyourSMTPaccount
SMTP_USERNAME=email@example.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
# Also used for SMTP as the address contact form submissions are sent to
BLOG_ADMIN_EMAIL=contact@example.com
BLOG_ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL=thisismyblog@gmail.com
BLOG_ADMIN_FULLNAME='Emily Smith'
```

<!-- tabs:start  -->

## **Install using Docker**

To install this project, you will need to have [Docker](<https://www.docker.com/get-started>) installed on your Computer.
Once your Docker configuration is up and ready, you can launch the project by running the following command in your terminal :

``` docker-compose up --build ```

Once the Docker container is built, go to <http://estellegaits:8080/> on your browser or localhost if you do not want to change your Windows vhost file, in which case, you need to update the following line from apache/apache.conf file line 1  and replace estellegaits with localhost :

```ServerName estellegaits```

Then go to <http://localhost:8080/> where you should be able to access the blog.

If you want to access the DBMS (phpmyadmin) to be able to see and manage your database, go to <http://estellegaits:8585/> or <http://localhost:8585/>, where you should be able to access the 'blog' database.

The generated Docker container uses Apache (2.4.33 Alpine), PHP8 (FPM Alpine), MySQL & phpMyAdmin.

## **Install on local webserver**

If you're unable to use Docker, you can install this project on your WAMP, Laragon, MAMP, or other local webserver.
To do so, you will first need to ensure the following requirements are met.

### Requirements

- You need to have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) on your computer
- Your server needs PHP version 8.0
- MySQL or MariaDB
- Apache or Nginx

The following PHP extensions need to be installed and enabled :

- pdo_mysql
- mysqli

### Install dependencies

Before running the project, you need to run the following commands in order to install the appropriate dependencies.

``` composer install ```

<!-- tabs:end  -->

### Import database files

To generate an empty database, you need to import the blog_empty.sql file into your DBMS.
You may need to change the default database name (blog) in the SQL file to match the allocated database name provided by your host.

```sql
-- Base de donnÃ©es : `blog`
```

Then, go to the website, register yourself as a user.
In order to become an admin (and therefore be able to write your own blog posts & use the admin dashboard), you need to update the role property of your user and set it to 1.
You can do this manually or with the following SQL request :

```sql
UPDATE `user` SET `role` = '1' WHERE `user`.`id` = 1;
```

> NB: Here 1 corresponds to the first created user. If you've created multiple users, you need to change the ID to the account you want to update.

Alternatively, if you wish to import and already prefilled database, use the blog.sql file instead.
